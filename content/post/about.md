As a programmer, *Hello world!* is the most familiar way to start a new advanture. 

So, since it's my first ever blog, or more precisely a space, I would like to state what I expect from building it.

### A notebook online

My first thought about the blog is a notebook for IT related material, to share knowledge. That's what I usually get from other IT guys' blogs. But then I found out I am not good at writing explanations and I have *Evernote* ... 

### A web playground

I began to learn more advanced web-tech a few months ago and were looking for a project to keep practising the aquired skills. I had tried making things *localhost* but it would always be of more motivations if the thing you build can deploy online and show (off) to others. Then I really took some times to find a way to host a site for free where I can build (almost) anything at will ...

### When I met Hugo

I have used Github over a year and *Github pages* was my first option. It's powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and somehow I found it not attractive enough. I dropped my space building for a while until I found [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) by accident (I was looking for a solution for [using MathJax in Markdown](http://gohugo.io/tutorials/mathjax/)). Then I found *Hugo* is a lovely name, with everything configurable and well documented. So, why not give it a shot?

### Suit up

For me, tools always come before builds. I would love to list my weapons below:

* *Markdown*: I used [MacDown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/) for all my .md file editing since I found it, very impressive real-time preview;
* *JavaScripts/html/css*: I am still hesitating between [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) and [HBuilder](http://dcloud.io/). Only time can tell who's the winner ...
* *Version control*: Git and Github, no doubt;
* *Debug*: chrome's DevTools is good enough and I'm just the beginner about it ([here](http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/) is the course I found about it).

### Talk less, code more

I know there should be a long time before anybody else reading my own blog and playing my toy apps. So I would keep my voice down and try to make my codes speak themselves. 

And lastly, forgive my poor English, I don't want to waste time double checking my grammar and spell any more. After all, the only sentence I guarantee perfectly right is *Hello world!* :)
